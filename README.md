# Sponsorship-Workflow-Engine
This challenge is designed to give space to showcase backend skills—especially around integrations, API design, and thoughtful infrastructure.

# Project Overview

This simple Flask service centralizes sponsorship tasks from multiple platforms into one place. By calling a single endpoint, you can:

* Ingest mock tasks from Salesforce, Asana, and Google Calendar

* Store them in memory (or swap in a database later)

* Filter and update task status via easy HTTP calls

* Auto‑sync on a schedule so you always have up‑to‑date information

Whether you’re managing contracts, creative reviews, or post‑event reports, this prototype shows how to unify and streamline sponsorship workflows under one roof.


# Future/Improvement Aspects
# (1) Security

* Use HTTPS and require an API key (or JWT) for every request

* Rate‑limit bad actors and log all access for auditing

# (2) Scaling

* Queue up sync jobs (e.g. with Redis/Celery) so slow APIs don’t block your app

* Containerize and spin up more workers when load spikes

# (3) Future AI Ideas

* Auto‑prioritize tasks that look critical or overdue

* Summarize today’s tasks in plain English and send as an email or chat bot message
